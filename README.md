## Data preprocessing steps:
- Annotated Furniture Images
	- Data Source: Google Images ( web scraped )
	- Obtained around 1000 images across 6 categories
	- The Images were labelled using LabelImg, object bounding boxes

<br>

## Model Construction:
-  For this project we have used YOLOv5 Model Architecture.
-  YOLO an acronym for 'You only look once', is an object detection algorithm that divides images into a grid system. Each cell in the grid is responsible for detecting objects within itself.
-  YOLO is one of the most famous object detection algorithms due to its speed and accuracy.



## Functionalities
-  It can be used to detect usable furniture such as  
	-  Chair
	-  Table
	-  Sofa
	-  Shoe Stand
	-  Bed
	-  Light Stand

## Instructions to run:

As of a typical Conv2D model, we see that the accuracy keeps improving in performance compared to the baseline.
